FREE INTERACTIVE GRAVITY SIMULATOR WRITTEN IN PYTHON AND PYGAME

Interactive python based gravity simulator written with Pygame and numpy.
This system simulates a system of particles revolving around another set of heavier particles.

For convenience, The smaller particles will be called planets and heavier ones will be called black holes.

At the start of the simulation, user is introduced to a world with only one back hole. There is nothing to revolve around it.

User can create planets to revolve around the black hole by left clicking on the screen.

Planet motion is modelled by using Newton's law of Universal gravitation and the laws of motion.

$\vec{F} = \frac{G.m1.m2}{r^3 }\vec{r}$ 

$\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$
